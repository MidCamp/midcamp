# MidCamp
## The Drupal 8 website for midcamp.org
[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/MidCamp/midcamp.svg?style=shield)](https://circleci.com/gh/MidCamp/midcamp)
[![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/MidCamp/midcamp/badges/gpa.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/MidCamp/midcamp)

## Site Setup

###  Development Environment

This site uses the Amazee.io Drupal Docker development environment. If you already have this, you can skip this bit entirely. Their [documentation for setup](https://docs.amazee.io/local_docker_development/local_docker_development.html) is amazeballz, but if you just want to quickly get going on your Mac:

- [Install pygmy](https://pygmy.readthedocs.io/en/master/installation/l) with `gem install pygmy`
- Start pygmy with `pygmy up`

You will be prompted to provide the passphrase for your ssh key. Comply.


### Getting Things Started

From inside the project root, run:

- `composer install`
- `npm ci`
- `docker-compose up -d --build`

Visit [midcamp.org.docker.amazee.io](http://midcamp.org.docker.amazee.io) in your browser of choice.  At this point you should see a Drupal installation page.  See below for Drush commands to install the site. 

### Working on a task

When beginning work on a task, start a new branch:

`git checkout -b feature/my-great-work`

Amazee [workflows](https://lagoon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using_lagoon/workflows/) will build a new environment for every branch that begins with `feature/` when it's pushed to GitHub. In order to access the environment for the branch above, visit https://nginx-midcamp-org-feature-my-great-work.us.amazee.io/. Databases for that environment are synced from Amazee dev, and it takes a few minutes after Circle completes for the install to complete.

### Stopping

Occasionally, you might want to stop working on this wonderful project. In that case:

- `pygmy stop       # Stop all pygmy services` if you just want a short pause, OR
- `pygmy down       # Stop and destroy all pygmy services` if you want to tear it all down, which is good especially if you're working with other local environments on the same machine.
- [just walk away](https://media.giphy.com/media/l0HlSlZmYf7lN2DEk/giphy.gif)â€”go outside, spend some time with family & friends, have a beverage, or just breathe.

## How do I work on this?

From inside the project root, type `docker-compose exec cli bash`

This is your project directory; run `drush` commands from here. Avoid using git from here, but if you must, make sure you configure your name and email for proper attribution:

```
git config --global user.email 'me@example.com'
git config --global user.name 'My Name'
```

## How do I Drupal?

### The Drupal root

This project uses [Composer Installers](https://github.com/composer/installers), [DrupalScaffold](https://github.com/drupal-composer/drupal-scaffold), and [the-build](https://github.com/palantirnet/the-build) to assemble our Drupal root in `web`. Dig into `web` to find the both contrib Drupal code (installed by composer) and custom Drupal code (included in the git repository).

### Using drush

You can run `drush` commands from anywhere within the repository, as long as you are ssh'ed into the container.

### Syncing your local environment

To get up and running locally, the easiest thing to do is update from the production database with:

```bash
dsql @production
```

If you want the files too, use:

```bash
drush rsync @production:%files @self:%files
```

### Adding modules

* Download modules with composer: `composer require drupal/bad_judgement:^8.1`
* Enable the module: `drush en bad_judgement`
* Export the config with the module enabled: `drush config-export`
* Commit the changes to `composer.json`, `composer.lock`, and `conf/drupal/config/core.extension.yml`. The module code itself will be excluded by the project's `.gitignore`.

### Working on the theme

As of 2019, component markup, styles and interactivity all live in the [Hatter Styleguide](https://github.com/MidCamp/hatter-v2)
The majority of theming work will occur in that repository and instructions are included in the [readme](https://github.com/MidCamp/hatter-v2/blob/master/README.md). 

The compiled assets are packaged as an npm dependency. To install the latest, run `npm install` either in the root of this
repository, or the theme directory. The initial setup process, along with the build process will install these
dependencies as well.

To update to the latest version of the Hatter Styleguide, change to the theme directory
and run `npm update @midcamp/hatter` Commit the resulting updates to package.json 
and package-lock.json

To include a specific version of the Hatter styleguide, update the version of the hatter dependency in `package.json` in
the related theme and them run `npm install`

### Local Drupal theme development

To streamline theme development in the context of Drupal, you can use NPM's link feature. 

First, in your local clone of the Hatter design system (hatter-v2) run:

* `npm link`

You'll only need to run this command once in the Hatter repository unless you remove or reinstall the package.

Then, in the Drupal theme directory (web/themes/custom/hatter_2019 for example,) run:

* `npm run watch-hatter`

This will link the Hatter package to your local development version of the pattern library, and watch for any changes.

When you're done with local theme development, run the following script to unlink your local version of Hatter and
re-install the published version of the package.

### Patching modules

Sometimes we need to apply patches from the Drupal.org issue queues. These patches should be applied using composer using the [Composer Patches](https://github.com/cweagans/composer-patches) composer plugin.

## How do I run tests?

* `vendor/bin/behat`
* `vendor/bin/phpcs --standard=vendor/drupal/coder/coder_sniffer/Drupal features/bootstrap web/modules/custom`
* `vendor/bin/phpmd web/modules/custom text .phpmd.xml`
  * This should be configured to show the same errors triggered by Code Climate that you see on the Pull Request.

## Troubleshooting

Be sure to visit the [Troubleshooting page](https://docs.amazee.io/local_docker_development/troubleshooting.html)

### Cannot connect to Docker daemon
If you get the following error from `pygmy up`:
> Cannot connect to the Docker daemon. Is the docker daemon running?

Make sure you have the Docker installed and running.

### Failed to start haproxy
If you get an error like this while running `pygmy up`:
> Error response from daemon: driver failed programming external connectivity on endpoint amazeeio-haproxy (2c5ed4b1999a8e5d586ca50f666e1ec0db012265375c60d780551b7368c351d0): Error starting userland proxy: Bind for 0.0.0.0:80: unexpected error (Failure EADDRINUSE)
> Error: failed to start containers: amazeeio-haproxy

Apache is probably already running on port 80 for your system. Run `sudo apachectl stop` and try again.

If this does not work, run `lsof -PiTCP -sTCP:LISTEN` and see what is using port 80. Kill it.

### I get the 'Could not load API JWT Token, error was:                                  [warning]'lagoon@ssh.lagoon.amazeeio.cloud: Permission denied (publickey). Error: no alias record could be found for source @production'

You will need someone on the Amazee Rocket Chat (https://amazeeio.rocket.chat/group/midcamp) to add your public SSH key on your account.  


### I can't see new things in the style guide

Are you sure your changes got merged to [Hatter's](https://github.com/MidCamp/hatter-v2) `master`?

### Drush is super slow.

Your firewall may be blocking requests to Amazee. Running drush with LAGOON_DISABLE_ALIASES=true 
may temporarily resolve the issue.

* `LAGOON_DISABLE_ALIASES=true drush <SOME-COMMAND-HERE>`
