## The Drupal 8 website for midcamp.org

## Site Setup

###  Development Environment

This site uses the Amazee.io Drupal Docker development environment. If you already have this, you can skip this bit entirely. Their [documentation for setup](https://docs.amazee.io/local_docker_development/local_docker_development.html) is amazeballz, but if you just want to quickly get going on your Mac:

- [Install pygmy](https://pygmy.readthedocs.io/en/master/installation/l) with `gem install pygmy`
- Start pygmy with `pygmy up`

You will be prompted to provide the passphrase for your ssh key. Comply.


### Getting Things Started

From inside the project root, run:

- `composer install`
- `docker-compose up -d --build`

Visit [midcamp.org.docker.amazee.io](http://midcamp.org.docker.amazee.io) in your browser of choice.  At this point you should see a Drupal installation page.  See below for Drush commands to install the site. 

### Stopping

Occasionally, you might want to stop working on this wonderful project. In that case:

- `pygmy stop       # Stop all pygmy services` if you just want a short pause, OR
- `pygmy down       # Stop and destroy all pygmy services` if you want to tear it all down, which is good especially if you're working with other local environments on the same machine.
- [just walk away](https://media.giphy.com/media/l0HlSlZmYf7lN2DEk/giphy.gif)â€”go outside, spend some time with family & friends, have a beverage, or just breathe.

## How do I work on this?

From inside the project root, type `docker-compose exec cli bash`

This is your project directory; run `drush` commands from here. Avoid using git from here, but if you must, make sure you configure your name and email for proper attribution:

```
git config --global user.email 'me@palantir.net'
git config --global user.name 'My Name'
```

## How do I Drupal?

### The Drupal root

This project uses [Composer Installers](https://github.com/composer/installers), [DrupalScaffold](https://github.com/drupal-composer/drupal-scaffold), and [the-build](https://github.com/palantirnet/the-build) to assemble our Drupal root in `web`. Dig into `web` to find the both contrib Drupal code (installed by composer) and custom Drupal code (included in the git repository).

### Using drush

You can run `drush` commands from anywhere within the repository, as long as you are ssh'ed into the container.

### Syncing your local environment

To get up and running locally, the easiest thing to do is update from the production database with:

```bash
drush sql-sync @production @self
```

If you want the files too, use:

```bash
drush rsync @production:%files @self:%files
```

### Adding modules

* Download modules with composer: `composer require drupal/bad_judgement:^8.1`
* Enable the module: `drush en bad_judgement`
* Export the config with the module enabled: `drush config-export`
* Commit the changes to `composer.json`, `composer.lock`, and `conf/drupal/config/core.extension.yml`. The module code itself will be excluded by the project's `.gitignore`.

### Working on the theme

The hatter designs are in a Butler styleguide at styleguide/. To use it, first you'll need to install. You can run the styleguide on either your host or your vm, but only the environment you install on. It's probably easiest on your host.

```
cd styleguide
npm install
```

## What does this Butler do?

Butler is tool to automate front-end development tasks and streamline prototyping. Run npm commands from the `styleguide/` directory:

* `npm run butler`

  This is the default task. This will watch your sass/spress files for changes and compile/build accordingly. It will also flag any sass linting errors before compiling. It will output CSS that has been been minified and optimized. While butler is running, the styleguide is available at http://midcamp.local:4000.

* `npm run butler -- sass`

  Just compile the sass. You can also use this syntax to run any task from the Gulpfile.

* `npm run tests`

  This is the testing task it will run linters as their own tasks. To learn more about configuring and customizing the linters for Butler check the [linters documentation](/docs/LINTERS.md).

  This task also checks for WCAG 2.0AA compliance using the [gulp-accessibility](https://github.com/yargalot/gulp-accessibility) plugin.

* `npm run deploy`

  This is a task to deploy the static styleguide to GitHub pages.

  Butler will build a Spress production artifact to `styleguide/output_prod` and deploy the production artifact to `gh-pages` branch of the repo defined in the `conf/butler.defaults.js`. Each commit for this process will default to the message: "Updated with Butler - [timestamp]".

  *Note: When you are deploying, Butler will ask you for your GitHub credentials at least once, possibly multiple times. Enter your own GitHub credentials as prompted.*


### Patching modules

Sometimes we need to apply patches from the Drupal.org issue queues. These patches should be applied using composer using the [Composer Patches](https://github.com/cweagans/composer-patches) composer plugin.

## How do I run tests?

* `vendor/bin/behat`
* `vendor/bin/phpcs --standard=vendor/drupal/coder/coder_sniffer/Drupal features/bootstrap web/modules/custom`
* `vendor/bin/phpmd web/modules/custom text .phpmd.xml`
  * This should be configured to show the same errors triggered by Code Climate that you see on the Pull Request.

## Troubleshooting

### Cannot connect to Docker daemon
If you get the following error from `pygmy up`:
> Cannot connect to the Docker daemon. Is the docker daemon running?

Make sure you have the Docker installed and running.

### Failed to start haproxy
If you get an error like this while running `pygmy up`:
> Error response from daemon: driver failed programming external connectivity on endpoint amazeeio-haproxy (2c5ed4b1999a8e5d586ca50f666e1ec0db012265375c60d780551b7368c351d0): Error starting userland proxy: Bind for 0.0.0.0:80: unexpected error (Failure EADDRINUSE)
> Error: failed to start containers: amazeeio-haproxy

Apache is probably already running on port 80 for your system. Run `sudo apachectl stop` and try again.

If this does not work, run `lsof -PiTCP -sTCP:LISTEN` and see what is using port 80. Kill it.

### I can't see new things in the style guide

Are you sure your changes got merged to [Hatter's](https://github.com/MidCamp/Hatter) `master`?
