MidCamp is dedicated to providing a safe, inclusive, welcoming, professional, harassment-free conference experience for everyone regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, religion and any other status protected by laws in which the conference or program is being held. The MidCamp Code of Conduct ensures we collectively create this kind of experience. This document expresses the behaviors we expect at MidCamp, what is unacceptable behavior, how we address unacceptable behavior, and how to ask for help if needed. All participants, including attendees, organizers, speakers, trainers, sponsors, exhibitors, vendors, volunteers, and event staff at MidCamp are required to abide by the MidCamp Code of Conduct. Event staff and their designated representatives will enforce this code throughout the event. We expect cooperation from all participants to help ensure a safe environment for everyone.</p><h3>Expected Behavior</h3><p>All event participants are expected to behave in accordance with professional standards, the MidCamp Code of Conduct, applicable laws, and to the extent not contrary to the above, their respective employer''s policies governing appropriate workplace behavior.</p><h4>We&nbsp;Are Considerate</h4><p>MidCamp is an international event that attracts diverse people from a wide variety of ethnic, cultural, and religious backgrounds. We acknowledge that cross-cultural communication can often be complicated and encourage everyone to consider the impact of their words and actions on those with different backgrounds and experiences.</p><h4>We Are Welcoming</h4><p>One of the greatest strengths of the Drupal community is our inclusiveness. Making all participants feel welcome and included at MidCamp is everyone’s job.</p><h4>We Are Respectful</h4><p>All participants should strive to treat each other with dignity and respect, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, religion and any other status protected by laws in which the conference or program is being held.</p><h4>We Are Collaborative</h4><p>If and when misunderstandings occur, we encourage people to work things out between themselves where this is practical. Where support is beneficial to achieve this, participants agree to ask for help. People are encouraged to take responsibility for their words and actions and listen to constructively-presented criticism with an open mind, courtesy, and respect. If people do not feel able to work out an issue between themselves, they are encouraged to seek advice of a third party to help mediate.</p><p>To get help mediating you may contact the Drupal Community Working Group at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:drupal-cwg@drupal.org">drupal-cwg@drupal.org</a>&nbsp;or with an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.drupal.org/governance/community-working-group/incident-report">online incident report</a>.</p><h4>We Lead By Example</h4><p>Anyone who represents the project, officially, informally, or otherwise, is a leader in our community. At MidCamp, leadership roles include, but are not limited to the <a href="/2025/organizers">organizing&nbsp;team</a>. Leadership is not an award, right or title; it is a privilege, a responsibility, and a mandate. As leaders, they must represent the best version of the Drupal community in what they say and do.</p><h3>Unacceptable Behavior</h3><p>We do not tolerate harassment and keep our conference a harassment-free zone for our attendees. Harassment will not be tolerated in any form, including but not limited to harassment based on gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, religion or any other status protected by laws in which the conference or program is being held. Any report of harassment at MidCamp will be addressed immediately.
