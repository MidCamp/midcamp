              value: "<p>By submitting to present a session at MidCamp you are confirming your understanding and acceptance of the rules and expectations as outlined below.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a MidCamp speaker, you are directly responsible for your session, its content, quality, and all deliverables.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Session Guidelines</h2>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>We encourage experienced speakers to submit talks for a beginner audience.</li>\r\n\t<li>Use a format that works for you and your topic: formal talk, panel, short documentary, spoken word, musical, etc.</li>\r\n\t<li>Sessions can be 60 minutes or 30 minutes.</li>\r\n\t<li>We prefer for sessions to be presented in English. If you need a translator, please mention that.</li>\r\n\t<li>You are welcome to submit more than one talk, but speakers will usually only have one session selected. (Some might appear also on a panel.)</li>\r\n\t<li>You may promote a project or organization you are working on if it is relevant, but please no sales pitches.</li>\r\n\t<li>We prefer speakers to speak on issues affecting groups they belong to, instead of speaking to issues on another group's behalf. (That is, a panel about \"Women in Drupal\" should be composed of women.)</li>\r\n\t<li>Speakers are expected to follow our <a href=\"/code-conduct\">code of conduct</a>.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>Diversity of Speakers</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>We're committed to fostering diversity on all levels at MidCamp. You can help make MidCamp more diverse by volunteering to be part of the session selection team. Tweet us at <a href=\"http://twitter.com/midwestcamp\">@midwestcamp</a> to help.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We try to coordinate session submission and selection as early as possible in order to allow speakers to make arrangements to attend early. Regardless of your skill level or experience with Drupal development, if you have a session you'd like to present at MidCamp but need help getting to camp or arranging accommodation, <a href=\"mailto:info@midcamp.org\">please let us know</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Selection</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>We may have one keynote presenter who would be an invited speaker. All other speakers will go through the selection process. We are reaching out to individuals and groups for submissions, and we'd love if you did the same. We want you to submit a talk too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MidCamp follows an anonymized session selection process. We believe blind selection will help remove subconscious biases from the selection process.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>A volunteer who is NOT on the selection team will anonymize and remove personally identifying information and gendered pronouns from abstracts/bios.</li>\r\n\t<li>The team will make the first round of selections from the anonymized submissions.</li>\r\n\t<li>A second round will then make sure we have not selected speakers multiple times (excluding panel participants).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>Compensation</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Speakers will receive a free ticket to the event. Travel and accommodation costs can be prohibitive for speakers. If you have a session you'd like to present at MidCamp but need help getting to camp or arranging accommodation, <a href=\"mailto:info@midcamp.org\">please let us know</a>. Need-based scholarships will be available. We are not yet able to pay speakers for their time.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Promotion</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>After sessions are selected, speakers are encouraged to promote their sessions through personal invitations and social media outlets like Twitter, personal blogs, and digital newsletters. Be sure to include @midwestcamp and #MidCamp in your tweets about the conference!</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Permissions</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>You must have explicit permission from your client/company to present any proprietary material in your session. Proposing a session without permission is grounds for session cancellation.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Session cancellation</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>MidCamp reserves the right to revise or cancel any events on the schedule should registration, venue, equipment or other conditions dictate. We will notify all involved speakers of any schedule modifications or cancellations as soon as possible. If for any reason a speaker must cancel a session, that speaker must contact MidCamp organizers so a substitute can be arranged.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Session AV + Setup</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Speakers should arrive at their room 10 minutes early for setup. You will have access to the session rooms prior to the first session of the day and during the breaks. There is WiFi available in all of the rooms, however, since connections to WiFi can sometimes be unreliable, we STRONGLY recommend you have the ability to do your session without a connection to the internet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sessions will be recorded&nbsp;and use&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.midcamp.org/speaker-resources-live-captioning-and-transcripts\">live captioning</a>. We will have a few volunteers running around to help with A/V. The recording kits accept HDMI and adapters will be available. If you think there might be a problem connecting, feel free to bring your own adapter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Folks with USB-c should bring a USB-c to HDMI or USB-c to&nbsp;VGA adaptors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What to bring:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Your laptop, with session slides loaded (it doesn't hurt to bring a backup USB)</li>\r\n\t<li>Your laptop's power adapter</li>\r\n\t<li>The appropriate power converter if you are visiting from another country</li>\r\n\t<li>The proper dongle/adapter/cable to connect your laptop.</li>\r\n\t<li>A slide advancer, if you want one</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>Session Recording</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>When you agree to speak at MidCamp, you consent for your talk to be recorded in audio and possibly video format.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We reserve the right to publicly distribute and publish these recordings and transcripts under the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 license.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Your session material, including content and recordings, may be used in various promotions or for other related endeavors. This material may also appear on the MidCamp website, social media channels or other digital mediums controlled by MidCamp.</p>\r\n"
