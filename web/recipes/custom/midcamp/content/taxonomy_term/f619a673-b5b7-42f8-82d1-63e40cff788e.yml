We have the opportunity to network, socialize, and enjoy the company of the Chicago and Midwest Drupal community at three different social events.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Traditionally, on Thursday night we have always held an event for Speakers, Organizers, and Sponsors. &nbsp;This year, we would like to open it up to all attendees that are already in town.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">On Friday night, we will have an on-site game night event. &nbsp;This was always been a big hit with the community to offer at least one low-key, alcohol-free event for all to attend. &nbsp;In 2017, we even had a food truck come to feed all the hungry gamers!</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">On Saturday night, we will have an off-site closing party at a nearby establishment in Lincoln Park.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>At this level, sponsors will receive:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\t<li>Your logo and mentions in opening and closing sessions before your party night</li>\r\n\t<li>Signage at party</li>\r\n\t<li>Company description on website</li>\r\n\t<li>Inclusion in emails when party is mentioned</li>\r\n\t<li>A table at the venue</li>\r\n\t<li>Up to 4 tickets</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n"
